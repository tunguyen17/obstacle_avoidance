# Wiki 

An self-driving car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. 

# Benefit 

A self-driving car at TSU can be a stepping stone to create a smart and efficient public transit system at TSU. 

- Self-driving cars can help students to move between parking lots and academic buildings. 
- Commuter students do not need to worry about finding close parking space, self driving car can connect distance parking lots with academic building

# This project 

We seek to develope and understand the alogrithm behind self-driving car. 

In 2015, Google DeepMind published a paper describing a system that combined deep neural network with reinforcement learning. 

Deep Q-Network train a computer program to play atari 2600 with superhuman level. 

We used this learning sytem to develop a self-driving car that avoid moving obstacles in a simulation.

# Next step

Our next step is to develope system that can combine distance sensor with computer vision.

Moving to real-world trainning and testing using RC car.
